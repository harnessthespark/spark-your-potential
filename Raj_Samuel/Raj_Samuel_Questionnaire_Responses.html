                <div class="response-label"><span class="outcome-number">1</span> AMV/BBDO & Brands Transformation</div>
                <div class="response-text">AMV/BBDO was the biggest agency in the UK - but they were getting systematically locked out of digital pitches. Clients saw them as TV craft specialists. Great at TV. Shit at digital. BT Digital was one of the rare pitches they even got invited to. They brought me in as a freelance planning director specifically for that pitch. We won it.

And then the real work started - because we'd promised digital capabilities we didn't actually have yet. We had to build them while delivering. What agency leadership couldn't see at first was that the real threat wasn't "we don't have digital departments" - it was that we'd stopped living in culture while everyone else was already there. I naturally saw this - the fix wasn't hiring digital specialists and calling it a day. It was teaching 450 people to think culturally first, with technology as just another tool for connection.

After the BT win, I became Board Account Planner, then Co-Innovation Director. Spent five years building what we'd promised: new departments, new ways of working, shifting our pitch pipeline from 90% TV to 60% integrated/digital. Basically repositioning how the entire agency operated.

We proved it worked through the actual client work. BT evolved from telco to tech brand - 2M+ people engaged. Aviva went from "insurance company" to "life enabler" - 2M visits across 87 countries. Mercedes shifted from pure TV to digitally-enhanced experiences that people actually wanted to participate in. Plus award-winning work for The Economist, Cancer Research UK, Famous Grouse. Each campaign proved the same thing: when you understand culture deeply, technology stops being a separate problem. It just becomes part of how you connect.</div>

            <div class="response-card">
                <div class="response-label"><span class="outcome-number">2</span> Cadbury Gorilla Digital (and launch)</div>
                <div class="response-text">Fallon brought me in to do the digital strategy for Cadbury. The creative team had come up with this absolutely insane idea - a drumming gorilla. No chocolate. No bite. Just a gorilla, Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight," and pure joy. The client was terrified. People at Cadbury genuinely thought they'd lose their jobs if they ran it - the brand had NEVER done an ad without someone taking a bite of chocolate. Never.

Part of my digital strategy work was running workshops to help them understand what this could mean. They kept saying this would make Cadbury a "content company" - which sounded adventurous but they didn't actually know what that meant. So I reframed it. I told them: this ad isn't the content strategy. It's an invitation. It's a promise that says "we have more fun like this coming" - and people will come searching for it. THAT'S what being in content means.

The workshop showed them how content actually lives in the world now - big brands, random kids online, everyone remixing everything. We had to figure out how to make people share what little we had - which was basically just one ad. So the digital strategy included building an online destination. Finding remixers online and getting them to remix the Gorilla with other 80s tracks - made it look like random people were doing it organically, not us.

The real clincher? The workshop created belief. Showed them proof of what could happen. Gave them the courage to actually run the thing. And then yeah, the ad became one of the most famous campaigns of the 2000s. The creative was brilliant - but it was the digital strategy and that workshop that gave them permission to be brave enough to greenlight it in the first place.

I kept working on Cadbury's digital strategy beyond Gorilla - helping them become an actual content brand, not just a chocolate company that did one viral ad.</div>

                <div class="response-label"><span class="outcome-number">3</span> Arley's Brand Creation</div>
                <div class="response-text">2020-2022. First time going client-side. Joined Arley's as Brand Director - plant-based food startup, crowded market, needed to build the entire brand from zero.

What changed was taking a generic "plant-based startup" idea and transforming it into a "heritage comfort brand" that secured listings with three major retailers in 12 months and attracted £1.2M in pre-launch revenue. What the founders couldn't see - and what I uncovered through research across five markets - was the "comfort paradox": 73% of flexitarian consumers actually wanted familiarity over innovation. Everyone in the category was chasing "the future" when the real opportunity was "the familiar, but better."

What came naturally was doing the cultural research that revealed this counterintuitive insight, then translating it into a brand story that investors and retailers immediately understood. We weren't selling disruption - we were selling comfort you could feel good about.

Startup life meant wearing multiple hats. I was designing investment decks, crafting the story for funding rounds, getting involved in naming conversations, packaging decisions - all of it. We worked with Mother, one of the most famous agencies in the UK, on the creative. The name ultimately became the name of the main founder's house - Arley's - which felt very British and homegrown. The logic worked. Mother came up with a design that felt properly British. Heritage. Real.

The positioning felt obvious in hindsight, but only because I'd made the invisible pattern visible. Brand's still going strong - now have their own factory, selling in retailers across Europe.</div>

                <div class="response-label"><span class="outcome-number">4</span> Malice Arts - Immersive Events</div>
                <div class="response-text">2014-2019. I'd always been fascinated by live events. Did club nights for years, kept evolving them to be more experiential - 3D glasses, making entire rooms fall in love, that kind of thing. Eventually realized I had to actually invest and make them full productions.

First one was Malice in Wonderland - took the original story and turned it into a horror experience. The Malice name stuck. The idea was always about adding darkness to existing themes, twisting things people knew into something new.

Bit brave taking existing IP and creating these underground events, but I got away with it. Sometimes did originals like 1984 vs 1984 (Orwell meets MTV) or Inferno/Paradiso (Heaven & Hell). But mostly twisted pop culture: Tron characters crash-landing in a club, Narnia glitching inside the Matrix, climate change hitting a surreal winterland.

Think it eventually became a learning lab for me - and I just kept going. Not just 3 or 4 events. Ten. 5,000+ guests across the series. 85% return rates. Secured brand sponsorships. Genuine press coverage.

What I proved was that when you create worlds people want to enter - not just events they attend - they come back and bring friends. Audiences don't just want to be entertained, they want to be transported. They're hungry for experiences that respect their intelligence and give them agency within a crafted narrative.

What came naturally was architecting these multi-sensory worlds where every element - music selection, spatial design, performer interactions, even the invitation sequence - built toward a cohesive emotional journey. Looking back, I was testing everything I believed about how culture and experience move people. And the metrics proved it worked.</div>

                <div class="response-label"><span class="outcome-number">5</span> Lemons.life → Quilter Partnership</div>
                <div class="response-text">Met Alex. Her husband had died young - suddenly faced with sorting out wills, financial planning, all of it while grieving. The system was broken, especially for women. We decided to co-found something to fix it. I came up with the naming and brand strategy.

Here's the thing - we could've just come up with a "wills" name. Keep it narrow. But I saw it bigger. We were originally just going to drive leads to someone else to sort out the actual wills. Standard referral model. But I went and found a wills company that does white labelling. Game changer. Because now we could own the customer data - not the wills info itself, just the marketing data. This was our saving grace. Now we had a reason to build a real brand and own the customer relationship.

So instead of "WillsForWomen" or whatever, we went with Lemons. "Life will always throw Lemons." Not just for wills. Any financial planning challenge. Preparing for future lemons. The brand had room to grow.

What I noticed early - and what others initially missed - was that the real story wasn't about death at all. It was about women's financial vulnerability. The massive gaps in planning for life transitions. Career breaks. Caring responsibilities. Divorce. Widowhood. All the lemons life throws at women specifically.

The Quilter partnership came through our wills provider - who's now a shareholder. And now the mission feels complete. Quilter's investing. They're providing female financial advisers to sell. Women selling to women. Turning the world of finance upside down for women. ISAs, pensions, life cover, the works.

What came naturally was taking a taboo topic (death) and reframing it through a culturally relevant lens (women's financial security) that felt urgent and actionable rather than morbid. The strategic positioning made the difference between being a niche will-writing service and becoming a platform that could genuinely expand financial security for our target audience.

Five years later, we're about to actually do it.</div>

                <div class="response-text">I spot the cultural-emotional truth hiding beneath the business problem - the thing people sense but can't articulate yet.

Everyone else sees the surface. I see what's actually underneath:

• AMV: "We need digital departments" → No, you've stopped living in culture
• Cadbury: "We're becoming a content company" → No, this ad is an invitation for more
• Arley's: "Plant-based = the future" → No, flexitarians want the familiar, done better

Then I make that truth tangible. Sometimes through strategic reframing, sometimes through research that reveals invisible patterns, sometimes through creating proof that builds belief. Whatever it takes to translate "this is where culture is already moving" into something concrete enough that people can act on it.

The unlock is always about giving people permission - permission to be brave, to reframe the problem, to see a bigger opportunity than they thought existed. I'm making the invisible visible. Making the path clear so they can actually walk it.

Looking back across these outcomes, the result always feels obvious in hindsight. But only because I made it visible first. That's the bit that comes naturally to me - spotting where culture's already going and architecting a way for brands to get there.</div>

                <div class="response-label">When You Knew Before You Knew</div>
                <div class="response-text">AMV/BT pitch. I'm transitioning from account management to planner - trying to prove myself in a new role. And we're going after BT's first big digital account. AMV kept getting locked out of digital pitches. This was one of the rare ones we got invited to.

We didn't actually have the digital capabilities yet. We were planning hires, building the case. But we had to tell BT we could deliver.

I'm looking at BT and something just clicks. They're a tech company stuck in the old days - calls are still massive revenue, so they're clinging to it. But their own broadband users are doing way bigger things than BT is doing as a brand.

In the pitch, I showed them where the world was heading. Then showed them the moment they'd become irrelevant if they didn't shift. Scared the shit out of them.

Then showed them their current campaign - very TV, very passive. People loved the soap opera but didn't actually like the brand. So I said: make it interactive. Let people participate. Then phase it out and match where the world's actually going. Put real money behind broadband, not just calls.

We were up against pure digital agencies. Two phases. 3-4 months. We won.

I knew before I could prove it that BT's problem wasn't needing digital tactics - it was being culturally stuck while their own customers had already moved on. I sensed it before I had the data. The pitch just made it visible.</div>

            <div class="response-card">
                <div class="response-label">Questions Only You Ask</div>
                <div class="response-text">I'm always asking about culture, emotion, play, and fun - looking for opportunities to leverage these that others don't see.

The questions that come up for me:

• "How can we make this about the audience, not just the brand?"
• "Where's the opportunity for play and interaction here?"
• "What would this look like if we gave people agency instead of just messaging at them?"
• "Where has culture already moved that this brand hasn't caught up to yet?"
• "What's the emotional truth underneath this business problem?"

Most briefs focus on outputs - the campaign, the message, the deliverables. I'm asking "what permission do people need?" and "what would make people actually want to participate?"

Like with BT - everyone else saw a soap opera campaign. I asked "what if the audience drove where the story goes?" We turned it interactive - pregnancy, engagement, wedding, wedding planning. People participated online, made the big decisions, steered future ads. Then we ended that story and started a new one with way more online interactivity. Now they were playing like a tech company with real benefits, not just a landline telco.

I'm always looking for where we can turn passive into active. Where we can add play. Where culture's already gone that the brand hasn't noticed yet.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="response-card">
                <div class="response-label">What You Notice First</div>
                <div class="response-text">I notice emotional disconnects before other people even realize there's a problem.

Like when brand messaging feels flat - not wrong exactly, just emotionally dead. Arley's talking about "the future of food" felt like that. Industry language, not human language.

I notice the gap between what people say and what they actually want. Arley's customers said "innovation" in focus groups but their behavior screamed "familiarity." Cadbury said "we need to be a content company" but what they really meant was "we're terrified of losing our jobs."

I notice when brands are culturally stuck while their audience has already moved on. BT's own broadband users were doing bigger things than BT was doing as a brand. The disconnect was obvious to me, invisible to them.

I notice when people are solving the wrong problem. AMV thought they needed digital departments. Nope - they'd stopped living in culture. Lemons looked like a wills startup. Nope - it was a future opportunity to address women's financial vulnerability across all life transitions.

I see these mismatches early. The thing people are saying out loud vs. the emotional truth underneath. The place where culture's already gone that the brand hasn't caught up to yet. That's what jumps out at me first.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="response-card">
                <div class="response-label">What Feels Easy</div>
                <div class="response-text">Spotting the cultural pattern or emotional disconnect. I walk into a room, hear the brief, and I just see where the mismatch is. Doesn't feel like heavy analysis - more like pattern recognition. I sense when something's emotionally flat, when people are solving the wrong problem, when culture's moved but the brand hasn't caught up.

I was able to apply this culture-first thinking across BT, Aviva, Cadbury, Mercedes - each time spotting where culture had already moved and the brand needed to catch up. It's the same lens every time: where's the emotional truth? Where's culture already gone? What permission do people need?

Connecting disparate things comes naturally too. Pop culture, human behavior, brand problems, entertainment - I weave these together without thinking about it. Even with Malice Arts, which was a side project, it was about the complexity of building experiential worlds and connecting the dots to story, current events, and technology. Taking Tron, Narnia, 1984 and remixing them into worlds people could step inside. That synthesis just happens for me.

And translating complex insights into simple reframes. Once I see the pattern, making it obvious to everyone else feels straightforward. "It's not about digital departments, it's about living in culture." "It's not a wills startup, it's about women's financial vulnerability." I don't overcomplicate - I clarify.

I think what makes these feel effortless is that I'm not forcing anything. I'm spotting what's already there - the cultural truth hiding in plain sight - and finding the simplest way to make it visible.</div>

Cadbury: "Of course this ad is an invitation for more content, not just a one-off."

Arley's investors and retailers: "Of course flexitarians want the familiar done better, not some futuristic innovation."

Lemons partnership: "Of course it's about women's financial vulnerability across all life transitions, not just wills."

BT: "Of course we should make the soap opera interactive and let people drive the story."

The "of course" moment is when I make the invisible pattern visible. I'm showing people something that was already there but they couldn't articulate yet. Then once they see it, they can't unsee it. It feels obvious in hindsight - but only because I made it visible first. That's what I do consistently - turn the hidden cultural truth into something concrete enough that everyone goes "oh, of course."</div>

                <div class="response-text">Legacy telco stuck in the past. Still clinging to landline calls as their main revenue even though the world had moved to broadband. Very TV-focused, passive advertising. Had this soap opera campaign people loved watching - but they didn't actually like the brand. Culturally disconnected from what their own customers were doing with their infrastructure. And they were skeptical AMV could deliver digital - we kept getting locked out of digital pitches.</div>

                <div class="response-text">Repositioned as a tech/broadband company. Made the soap opera interactive - people participated online, drove the story, voted on life moments. Shifted from passive to active. We won the pitch, then kept winning - interactivity work, loads of ads, next campaign, Olympics work. All from that first pitch win.

But here's the thing - BT evolved AND we evolved. They had to believe in AMV to deliver their new strategy. We had to build capabilities we'd promised but didn't fully have yet. It wasn't just me changing them - we changed each other. I was the bridge. Nearly 2M people engaged over the years. They caught up to where their customers already were. And we proved we could compete in digital.</div>

                <div class="response-text">People bring me problems that aren't really about what they say they're about.

They say "we need a digital strategy" but what they actually mean is "we feel culturally stuck and don't know how to catch up."

They say "we need brand positioning" but what they really mean is "we don't know who we are anymore and it's showing."

They say "we need innovation" but what they're actually asking is "give us permission to be brave."

People bring me the "something feels off but we can't articulate what" problems. The cultural disconnect problems. The transformation problems where they know they need to evolve but don't know how. The courage problems where they need someone to make the scary thing feel doable.

I get brought in when brands feel emotionally flat, when positioning doesn't land, when there's a gap between where the brand is and where culture's already gone. When leadership senses they're solving the wrong problem but can't see what the right one is yet.

Basically, people come to me when they need someone to see the pattern they can't see and make the invisible visible.</div>

                <div class="response-text">When people refer me, they tend to describe what I do rather than who I am:

"Call Raj when you're culturally stuck and don't know why."
"He makes the complex stuff simple."
"He gives you permission to try the scary thing."
"He spots the pattern we were all missing."

People think of me when:

• A brand feels disconnected from where culture's actually gone
• They need to do something bold but need someone to make it feel doable
• There's a transformation problem that feels stuck
• They need someone who operates between big brand experience and cultural instinct
• They want strategic thinking that doesn't feel corporate

I think people see me as someone who operates between worlds - big brand credibility but with underground experiential instincts. Strategic but not stuffy. Someone who spots where culture's already moved and makes the path visible so others can walk it.</div>
