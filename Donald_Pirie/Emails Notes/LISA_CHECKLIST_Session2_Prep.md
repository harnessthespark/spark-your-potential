# Lisa's Checklist - Preparing Donald for Session 2

## Tomorrow (Day 1):
- [ ] **Send Email #1** (Career Insights Report)
  - Copy from: `/Users/lisagills/spark-your-potential/COPY_PASTE_EMAIL_Donald.txt`
  - Attach: `/Users/lisagills/spark-your-potential/Donald_Pirie_Session2_Career_Insights_Report.html`
  - Timing: Morning (gives him 24-48 hours to read before Session 2)

## Day After Tomorrow (Day 2):
- [ ] **Send Email #2** (Decision-Making Framework)
  - Copy from: `/Users/lisagills/spark-your-potential/FOLLOWUP_EMAIL_Framework.txt`
  - Attach: `/Users/lisagills/spark-your-potential/Donald_Pirie_Session2_Decision_Making_Framework.html`
  - Timing: 24 hours after first email

## Before Session 2:
- [ ] Check if Donald has questions or needs clarification
- [ ] Confirm he's had time to read the report
- [ ] Ask if he's started the scorecard (no pressure if not)
- [ ] Have both documents open during the session for reference

## Session 2 Prep Notes:

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. "What surprised you most in the report?"
2. "What resonated as absolutely true?"
3. "Looking at your scorecard, which opportunity is emerging as a better fit?"
4. "How does each opportunity make you feel emotionally?"
5. "What's your authenticity rating for each? (/10)"

**Watch For:**
- Is he trying to talk himself into the "safe" choice (B2B agency = familiar)?
- Is he avoiding the "scary" choice because it's different (Smart Energy)?
- Are either of these actually right—or should he keep looking?
- Does he need permission to say "neither of these is good enough"?

**Your Role:**
- Help him trust his gut as much as the numbers
- Give permission to be honest about deal-breakers
- Remind him: he's not desperate, he has extraordinary capabilities
- Challenge "settling" - he deserves a role that charges his battery

**By End of Session 2:**
- He should have clarity on which direction (if either) feels right
- Begin building conviction (emotional + rational)
- Set up for Session 3: crafting his NEW positioning statement
