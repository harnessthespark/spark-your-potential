Hi Donald,

Alongside your Career Insights Report, I'm also sharing your Career Blueprint - this is the living document we're building together over 4 weeks.

You'll see:
- Week 1 (Foundation) is complete - all your responses and patterns captured
- Week 2 (Career Direction) is in progress - we'll build this together in Session 2
- Weeks 3-4 are locked - they'll unlock as we progress through the programme

Think of this as your career transformation archive - by Week 4, you'll have a complete blueprint to guide your next move and beyond.

See you in Session 2!
Lisa
