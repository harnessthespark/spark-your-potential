## üîç Red Flags to Watch For

### **Minimising Language:**
- "I just..." / "I only..." / "Anyone could..."
- **Coach response:** "Let's test that. How many people actually do this?"

### **Vague Descriptions:**
- "I help them feel better" / "I make things easier"
- **Coach response:** "What specifically changed? What did they say?"

### **Skipping Sections:**
- Empty "Effortless Ability" section
- **Coach response:** "This is where your gold is. What feels ridiculously easy to you?"

### **Over-Explaining:**
- Paragraphs of context before the actual ability
- **Coach response:** "What's the one-sentence version? The thing you did?"

## üíé Gold Nugget Phrases to Listen For

When clients write these, PAUSE and dig deeper:

- "I don't know how I knew, I just knew"
- "Doesn't everyone see this?"
- "It's so obvious to me, why isn't it obvious to them?"
- "I can't not notice when..."
- "People always come to me for..."
- "I thought it was common sense but..."

**These are their superpowers hiding in plain sight.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Troubleshooting

### **Client Says: "AI buttons aren't working"**
1. Check health endpoint: https://stingray-app-7kg9p.ondigitalocean.app/health
2. Verify `"aiConfigured": true`
3. If false, check DigitalOcean environment variables
4. Redeploy if needed (Settings ‚Üí Force Redeploy)

### **Client Says: "My progress disappeared"**
- Auto-save uses browser localStorage
- Ask: Same browser? Incognito mode? Cleared data?
- Solution: Have them download frequently

### **Google Sheets Not Receiving Data**
1. Test the script: https://script.google.com/home
2. Check script is deployed as Web App
3. Verify "Who has access: Anyone"
4. Check spreadsheet permissions (you need edit access)

### **App is Down**
1. Check DigitalOcean app status
2. Check runtime logs for errors
3. Verify npm packages installed correctly
4. Check Node.js version (requires ‚â•18.x)

## üìà Usage Monitoring

### **Check Logs:**
DigitalOcean Apps ‚Üí Your app ‚Üí Runtime Logs

```
‚úÖ Spark Your Potential server running on port 8080
ü§ñ AI Analysis: ENABLED
AI Analysis - Type: patterns, Tokens: {"input_tokens":500,"output_tokens":400}
```

### **Cost Tracking:**
- Each AI analysis logs token usage
- Multiply by Anthropic pricing:
  - Input: $3 per 1M tokens
  - Output: $15 per 1M tokens
- Typical analysis: ~500 input, ~400 output = ~$0.008
