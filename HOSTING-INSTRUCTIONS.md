## Important Notes

### ‚úÖ What Works from Local Files:
- All form fields and text inputs
- Auto-save to localStorage
- Google Sheets integration
- Instinct Radar visualization
- Download/Email results
- All styling and layout

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Requires Server Hosting:
- AI analysis buttons (Claude API calls blocked by CORS on file://)
- "Help Me See Patterns with AI"
- "Reveal My Unlock Pattern with AI"

### üîë For AI Features to Work:

You need to add your Anthropic API key. Currently the API calls will fail without authentication.

**To enable AI features:**

1. Get API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Add to the HTML file around line 1540
3. Or proxy through SparkHub backend (more secure)
