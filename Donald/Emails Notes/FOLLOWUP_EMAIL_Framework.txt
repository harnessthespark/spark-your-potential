SUBJECT: Decision-Making Framework for Session 2

---

Hi Donald,

As promised, here's the Decision-Making Framework to help you evaluate the two opportunities (or any future opportunities).

This framework is built directly from your patterns and what you learned from UBS and VML experiences. It includes:

• The Four Core Tests (Belief Transformation, Authenticity, Sustainability, Growth & Impact)
• A detailed scorecard to rate opportunities out of 10 on 18 criteria
• Your deal-breakers (red flags to avoid, green flags to pursue)
• Interview questions to ask to gather information
• Reflection prompts to interpret your scores

How to use it:

1. Score both opportunities (B2B agency and Smart Energy) against each criterion
2. Be honest - this is for you, not them
3. Pay special attention to any scores below 4 on "High Weight" criteria - these are potential deal-breakers
4. Trust your gut as well as the numbers - if something scores high but doesn't feel right, that's important data

We'll review your completed scorecard together in Session 2 and use it to build clarity on which direction serves you best.

No pressure to complete everything - we can work through parts of it together if needed.

See you soon,
Lisa
