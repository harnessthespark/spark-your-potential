                    <p class="response-text">I helped 3 major agencies create more effective Effies papers, drawing a clear line between their comms activities and the business and marketing effects. I built them a stronger, tighter and more compelling story that increased their chances of winning an award.</p>

                    <p class="response-text">For UBS, we noticed that their brand campaign wasn't being followed through the journey and they needed both a compelling front end and rigorous back end infrastructure. I enabled a digital brand journey, content magnets and campaign structure which not only increased familiarity (the brand team's goal) but leads (the goal of wealth management, the lead business unit), building a new client relationship in the process and driving leads.</p>

                    <p class="response-text"><strong>Challenge:</strong> Reposition UBS.com for a new generation of HNWIs and corporates who viewed the brand as legacy.

<strong>Insight:</strong> In wealth management, the digital experience is the brand — credibility depends on premium, seamless journeys.

<strong>Role:</strong> Created new ubs.com purpose, audience strategy, measurement, and connected journeys.

<strong>Impact:</strong> Transformed UBS.com into the brand's flagship, increasing leads and client revenue.

UBS was still seen as a traditional analogue brand and UBS.com wasn't doing the job of creating a seamless digital experience for a new generation of HNWIs. I and the team embedded ourselves with the client to deliver and educate UBS on a transformation strategy. We created a .com purpose, audience frameworks, customer journeys, measurement framework and governance tools in collaboration with brand team and BUs.

<strong>Wrap-up:</strong> We turned UBS.com into a digital crown jewel — a seamless luxury experience that proved technology can deliver trust, consistency, and growth.</p>

                    <p class="response-text">UPS needed to elevate itself above commodities logistics. We found an insight: Its real value came from solving complex business problems — something employees lived daily but the world rarely saw.

Getting under the skin of the company, with the team, we redefined UPS as "United Problem Solvers" and built a world-first UPS × TED platform for employees to share solutions on the world stage.

<strong>Impact:</strong> Boosted revenue growth, brand perception, and employee pride for 400,000 staff worldwide.

<strong>Wrap-up:</strong> We proved UPS wasn't just about parcels — it was about people solving problems through human ingenuity, and its meaningful impact on businesses and people.

Getting under the skin of the company, we saw AMD's real differentiator was its capability to advance the world.

<strong>Impact:</strong> Elevated AMD from a specs-driven competitor to a visionary leader recognised by analysts, investors, and customers.

<strong>Wrap-up:</strong> We shifted AMD from promoting specs to shaping progress — establishing it as a visionary leader that advances both industry and society.

With Effies papers, I connected comms activities to business results. With UBS, I saw that digital wasn't just a channel — it was the brand itself for a new generation. With UPS, I uncovered that their real value wasn't logistics, it was human problem-solving, and we created a platform that let the world see it.</p>

            <div class="unlock-box">
                <p>Right before the unlock, I'm usually doing something that feels uncomfortable for clients — asking questions that expose the gap between their internal reality and external perception. With UPS, I kept pressing: "What do your people actually do all day that no one outside these walls ever sees?" I wasn't accepting the safe answers — the "solutions" and "advice" language they'd always hidden behind.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Then comes the moment. For me, it's quiet and not dramatic.</strong></p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">For this client it happened in a working session when someone from their side — not me — said out loud: "We're business partners, aren't we? We don't just process logistics, we help businesses grow in a world of complexity."</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The room shifted. I could feel it and I took on that statement, persuasively and passionately creating a narrative that they got behind.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>What I do right before that moment is create the conditions for it.</strong> I listen deeply, I mirror back what I'm hearing in a way that reveals a pattern they can't see themselves, and I hold for the right moment for the truth to emerge — even when it's inconvenient or challenges the status quo.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;">The unlock isn't me giving them the answer. It's me asking the right questions, hearing themselves think differently and persuading them of the great implications of what this could mean for them.</p>

                <p class="response-text"><strong>Strategic Clarity (my superpower)</strong>

Making sense of complexity.
I can walk into a dense business problem — layers of data, competing opinions, shifting briefs — and instinctively find the through-line. Synthesizing the noise into a clear, motivating story feels so natural I sometimes forget it's a skill.

<strong>Connecting Creativity to Commercial Impact</strong>

Linking creative ideas to commercial outcomes. For me, creativity and effectiveness have never been opposites — they're part of the same equation. Translating a brand idea into measurable business impact just feels intuitive, like breathing.

<strong>Reading the room and reframing the narrative.</strong>
I can sense when a team, client, or idea has lost its centre — and naturally find the language or angle that brings everyone back into alignment. It doesn't feel like effort; it's just how my brain works.

<strong>Helping others think more clearly and feel reassured.</strong>
I find it easy to unlock other people's thinking — to simplify, sharpen, and reframe until they see the path forward themselves. It's called "mentoring" or "facilitation" in corporate speak, but to me it's just conversation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="response-card">
                <div class="response-label">"Of Course" Moments</div>
                <p class="response-text"><strong>The Simplifier of Complexity</strong>

"Of course — it's not about selling the product, it's about proving the our promise." I can take a dense ecosystem (tech, finance, logistics, transformation) and distil it into a story people feel and believe. I cut through technical clutter and bring it back to the simple, human truth that makes the business make sense.

"Of course — brand and performance aren't separate things. They're two sides of the same growth system."
Clients come to me thinking in silos — brand here, demand there. I help them see how brand strategy fuels pipeline, how creative drives ROMI, and how the two reinforce each other in measurable ways. I can make the invisible connection obvious.

"Of course — that's why it isn't working."
I have an instinct for spotting contradictions others miss — when the brand promise, people's expectations, customer experience, and communications aren't aligned. I can reframe the problem not as "How do we say it better?" but "How do we make it truer for everyone?"

I bring empathy and language that cuts through jargon. I make clients and others realise that the real competitive advantage isn't technology or spend — it's humanity. I give brands and organisations permission to sound like people again.

"Of course — creativity only matters if it moves the numbers."
I bridge art and analytics naturally. When others hide behind buzzwords or metrics, I reframe effectiveness as the creative act itself — proving that emotion and evidence can (and must) coexist.</p>

                    <p class="response-text" style="color: #991b1b;">UBS was a world-class financial institution that looked and sounded like every other bank in its category — rational, conservative, and self-referential.

Their communications and experiences were siloed, product-led, not purpose-led. They talked about "solutions," "advice," and "markets," but rarely about people. Internally, marketing was often viewed as a cost centre rather than a growth engine.

They behaved like a cautious siloed incumbent — measured, careful, and constrained by compliance and hierarchy. The creative work reflected that: technically correct, emotionally invisible.</p>

                <div class="after-box">
                    <h4>✅ Client After</h4>
                    <p class="response-text" style="color: #166534;">UBS began to think and act like a team, and as a modern, human brand — one with a unifying philosophy and a clear organising idea: "Banking is our craft." (our brand platform for them)

They started telling stories about people, not products — craftsmanship over commoditisation. That shift reoriented team involved in everything from comms to client experience to UBS.com. Marketing evolved from explaining what they do to demonstrating who they are.

Culturally, teams became braver. They leaned into creative partnerships, worked more closely with each other, built a digital-first ecosystem, and started measuring effectiveness not just by efficiency, but by brand and behavioural outcomes.

They went from a bank that communicated like a bank to a brand that acted like a craftsperson — confident, creative, and customer-obsessed.</p>

                <div class="response-label">Problem Magnet</div>
                <p class="response-text">People come to me when things feel stuck.
When the story doesn't add up, when teams are circling without progress, when team members feel lost, or when the business knows what it does — but can't articulate why it matters.

They may call it a strategy problem, a brand problem, or a go-to-market challenge, but what they're really bringing me is a clarity problem.

I attract problems where complexity, ego, and emotion have tangled together — where logic alone won't fix it, and creative energy needs direction.

<strong>The Problems They Bring (Even When I Don't Advertise It)</strong>

• Brand paralysis: "We can't explain who we are anymore — every deck says something different."
• Team misalignment: "The marketing team says brand, sales says pipeline, the C-suite says ROI — and we can't find the common language."
• Creative conflict: "We've got all the ingredients for great work, but the team's lost belief in the idea."
• Purpose drift: "We've got numbers and targets, but no narrative anyone's proud of."
• Leadership friction: People quietly ask for your read on dynamics — "Why isn't this team clicking?", "Why does everything feel heavier than it should?"

<strong>The Hidden Human Layer</strong>

Even when I'm brought in for strategy, I end up diagnosing people's beliefs — helping people reconnect to meaning, possibility, and each other.

I give individuals and teams permission to drop the armour, say what they actually think, and rebuild clarity and confidence from there.

I turn something personal into something workable.</p>

            <div class="response-card">
                <div class="response-label">How Others See You</div>
                <p class="response-text">People see me as the person who brings clarity when things are murky. I'm the one they call when the story has lost its shape, the strategy feels abstract, or a team needs to rediscover what actually matters.

They describe me as thoughtful, calm, sharp, and unfailingly grounded — the strategist who can turn complexity into something simple, human, and motivating. Clients talk about my ability to "make everything click." Colleagues often say I'm the adult in the room — sometimes because I'm cautious, but also because I bring perspective and pattern recognition when others are still reacting.

People trust me because I don't posture or spin; I listen, distil, and then drop the one line that reframes the entire problem.

I'm not the loudest voice in the room — and sometimes, in rooms full of senior stakeholders, that makes it harder to find my moment to speak. But when I do, people stop talking. My contribution carries weight precisely because it's measured. I don't perform or shout loudly, I clarify.

People often say, "I wish you'd spoken sooner — that's exactly what we needed to hear." That's also part of my power: you speak when it matters.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <p><strong>Underestimated Ability:</strong> My underestimated ability is how powerfully I can shift belief — not just thinking. I don't just clarify; I change how people feel about the work, each other, and what's possible.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Pattern Recognised:</strong> Transformation through clarity — taking something complex, fragmented, or forgotten and giving it focus, humanity, and momentum. I turn big, abstract ambitions into stories people can believe in and act on.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Transformation I Enable:</strong> I help people move from confusion to conviction. They leave my conversations clearer, more confident, and reconnected to an overall purpose — able to see not just what to do next, but why it matters.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Permission I'm Giving Myself:</strong> I'm giving myself permission to own the scale of my impact — to stop downplaying the fact that I don't have the confidence to make my voice heard. I'm willing to claim that I can transform how organisations and people think, feel, and perform.</p>

                Across every transformation you've led — UBS, UPS, AMD — you turn confusion into conviction. Teams arrive stuck and paralysed; you find the human truth beneath the noise, and they don't just get a strategy — they get belief back.
