## TASK 1: Royal Academy Deep Dive
**Time: 20 minutes**

You've already scored Edelman. Now let's prepare you to properly evaluate Royal Academy in Session 3.

### **Research & Reflection:**

**Part A: Do Your Homework (10 mins)**
1. Review the Royal Academy job description thoroughly
2. Look at their website/recent news about modernization efforts
3. Note down:
   - What excites you most about this role?
   - What concerns you most?
   - What's unclear or needs investigation?

**Part B: Gut Check (10 mins)**

Answer these quick questions:

**Compared to Edelman (which you scored 8/10 for authenticity):**
- Does Royal Academy feel MORE or LESS aligned with your 10/10 authentic role?
- What's the biggest difference between these two opportunities?
- If you had to choose TODAY (with limited info), which direction does your gut lean?

**Three biggest questions you need answered about Royal Academy:**
1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________
3. ________________________________________________

### **What to bring to Session 3:**
Your notes on what excites/concerns you, and your three biggest questions. We'll use these to develop your interview strategy and positioning for cultural sector roles vs. agency roles.

## TASK 2: Your One-Sentence Introduction
**Time: 15 minutes**

You know how positioning works for brands. Now apply it to yourself.

At a networking event or in an interview, someone asks "So, what do you do?" You have one sentence to make them curious.

### **Complete this:**

**"I'm Donald, I..."** (or start however feels natural)

### **The Challenge:**

You know "strategist" is too generic. You know task descriptions are forgettable. 

So what's YOUR positioning? What's the transformation at the heart of your work?

### **Look at your three moments:**
- UBS: Banking is our Craft
- UPS: United Problem Solvers  
- Juniper: The Now Way to Network

What was the actual transformation in each case? Not the campaign, not the strategy deck—the shift that happened.

### **Write 3 versions:**

**Version 1:**  
"_____________________________________________________________________________"

**Version 2:**  
"_____________________________________________________________________________"

**Version 3:**  
"_____________________________________________________________________________"

### **Test:**
- Would you actually say this?
- Does it differentiate you from other strategists?
- Would it make someone ask a follow-up question?

**Which version feels most authentic to you?** We'll refine it together in Session 3.

## TASK 3: Your "Not This, But That" List
**Time: 10 minutes**

You know how clear positioning often comes from contrast. What you're NOT is as powerful as what you ARE.

### **Complete these contrasts:**

| I'm NOT... | I AM... |
|------------|---------|
| Just a deck-writer who delivers and leaves | |
| An ad maker focused on campaigns | |
| A typical agency strategist | |
| Working on surface-level creative | |

### **Now add 3 more of your own:**

| I'm NOT... | I AM... |
|------------|---------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

### **Why this matters:**

These contrasts become your differentiation. They're what you say when someone asks "How are you different from other strategists?"

Think about:
- What makes you cringe in job descriptions vs. what excites you
- The work that drains you vs. charges you up
- The environments where you thrive vs. where you feel inauthentic

---

## TASK 4: Your Interview Questions for Royal Academy
**Time: 15 minutes**

You've got the framework questions. Now make them specific to Royal Academy's context.

### **Your questions (5-10 total):**

Focus on what YOU actually need to know about this role, based on:
- Your Royal Academy research
- What concerns you most
- What you need proof of (not just aspirational talk)

### **Organize by what matters to you:**

**About Transformation & Belief:**
1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________

**About Authenticity & Culture:**
1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________

**About Sustainability & Pace:**
1. ________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________

**About Impact & Growth:**
1. ________________________________________________

### **Make them sharp:**

You know the difference between a generic question and one that actually reveals culture.

Generic: "What's the culture like?"  
Sharp: "The RA is modernising—how does that tension between tradition and innovation show up in how decisions get made?"

Generic: "What does success look like?"  
Sharp: "Given the RA's diverse stakeholders—members, public, donors—how do you define and measure success for brand work?"

Your questions should make them think, not just recite the job description.

---

## TASK 5: Your "Why Now?" Story
**Time: 15 minutes**

When someone asks "Why are you looking for a new role right now?" what's your answer?

This needs to be:
- **Honest** (but not oversharing)
- **Forward-looking** (not bitter about the past)
- **Authentic** (sounds like you, not a script)

### **Draft your 3-4 sentence response:**

"____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________

____________________________________________________________________"

### **Elements to consider including:**

**What you've learned:**
- From UBS (what doesn't work for you)
- From VML (confirmation of what you need)
- From your career arc (what you're ready for now)

**What you're moving toward:**
- Transformation over transactions
- Building over making
- Meaning over just money

**What excites you:**
- Organisations like Royal Academy that...
- The chance to...
- Work that allows me to...

### **Test it:**
Read it out loud. Does it sound like you? Would you want to hear more if someone said this to you?

## BONUS TASK (Optional): Your LinkedIn Headline
**Time: 10 minutes**

If you have time, take a shot at rewriting your LinkedIn headline.

**Current format:** [Job Title] | [Company]  
**New format:** What you DO | Who you help | How you're different

**Example structure:**
"Transformational Strategist | Helping [type of organisations] restore belief and build brand platforms that last"

**Your draft:**

"____________________________________________________________________"

Don't worry if it's not perfect—we'll workshop this together in Session 3!

**Minimum (Must Have):**
1. Your one-sentence introduction - pick your favorite version

5. Your Royal Academy-specific interview questions

**How to send:**

- Don't stress about polish—rough is perfect!
- The goal is to give us YOUR language to refine together

---

## 💡 LISA'S TIPS

**If you get stuck:**

**On the one-sentence intro:** Look back at your three moments of belief (UBS, UPS, Juniper). What's the transformation that happened in each? That's your answer.

**On "Not This, But That":** Think about job descriptions that make you cringe vs. ones that excite you. What's the difference?

**On Royal Academy prep:** You don't need all the answers. Note what you DON'T know—that becomes our interview strategy.

**On interview questions:** Use the framework questions as a starting point and make them specific to Royal Academy's context (arts, cultural institution, modernization mission, diverse stakeholders).

**On "Why Now?":** You're not broken and need fixing. You're experienced and know what you need. That's powerful—own it.

## ⏰ TIME MANAGEMENT

**Short on time? Prioritise in this order:**

1. **TASK 2** (One-sentence intro) - 15 mins  
   *This is THE foundation for your positioning*

2. **TASK 3** (Not This, But That) - 10 mins  
   *This clarifies your differentiation*

3. **TASK 1** (Royal Academy prep) - 20 mins  
   *Context for Session 3 discussion*

4. **TASK 5** (Why Now story) - 15 mins  
   *Your narrative framework*

5. **TASK 4** (Royal Academy questions) - 15 mins  
   *Interview strategy*

**Got only 30 minutes?** Do Tasks 2 and 3. These give us the positioning foundation to work with in Session 3.

## 🎯 WHY WE'RE DOING THIS

Session 3 is about **POSITIONING & NARRATIVE**—giving you language that:
- Sounds like YOU (authentic, not scripted)
- Explains your DIFFERENCE (not "just another strategist")
- Attracts the RIGHT opportunities (repels the wrong ones)
- Works across contexts (LinkedIn, interviews, networking)

**We've already done the foundation work:**
- ✅ Your patterns and evidence (Week 1)
- ✅ Your career direction and non-negotiables (Week 2)

**Now we're building your external voice:**
- 🎯 How you introduce yourself
- 🎯 How you differentiate yourself
- 🎯 How you tell your story
- 🎯 How you evaluate opportunities in real-time

Your homework gives us YOUR raw language to refine. The more you draft in your own words, the more authentic your final positioning will be.

**Remember:** This isn't busywork. Every exercise directly feeds into:
- Your NEW LinkedIn headline and profile
- Your elevator pitch for networking
- Your interview answers to "Tell me about yourself"
- Your ability to position yourself for Royal Academy vs. Edelman vs. future opportunities

**You're not learning to talk like a coach told you to. You're finding YOUR language for what you already know about yourself.**

Let's do this! 🚀
