## Session 2 Coaching Prep

### Key Questions to Ask in Session 2:
1. "What surprised you most in the report?"
2. "What resonated as absolutely true?"
3. "Looking at your scorecard, which opportunity is emerging as a better fit?"
4. "How does each opportunity make you feel emotionally?"
5. "What's your authenticity rating for each? (/10)"

### Watch For:
- Is client trying to talk themselves into the "safe" choice because it's familiar?
- Is client avoiding the "scary" choice because it's different?
- Are either of these opportunities actually right—or should they keep looking?
- Does client need permission to say "neither of these is good enough"?

### Your Role as Coach:
- Help client trust their gut as much as the numbers
- Give permission to be honest about deal-breakers
- Remind client: they're not desperate, they have extraordinary capabilities
- Challenge "settling" - they deserve a role that charges their battery

### By End of Session 2:
- Client should have clarity on which direction (if either) feels right
- Begin building conviction (emotional + rational)
- Set up for Session 3: crafting their NEW positioning statement

## Client Example: Donald Pirie

### Donald's Pattern:
**Core Pattern:** "You don't fix strategies. You restore belief systems."

**AI Pattern Analysis:** You Turn Confusion Into Conviction

**AI Unlock Pattern:** Reframe from "strategist" to "belief architect who uses strategy as the delivery system"

**The Thread:** "My ability to see a bigger story than the one I've been asked to tell—to tell it, then build the teams and capabilities to make it real."

**Current Situation:**
- Weary from VML (ad agency feels limiting)
- Evaluating two opportunities: B2B agency vs Smart Energy role
- Seeking emotional + rational clarity
- Wants authentic work that charges his battery

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Deal-breakers: Ad factories, unsustainable pace, playing a role, marketing as cost centre
- Green flags: Brand platform environments, embedding transformation, measured wisdom valued, depth work

### Donald's Files Created:
✅ Donald_Pirie_Session2_Career_Insights_Report_REVISED.html
✅ Donald_Pirie_Session2_Decision_Making_Framework.html
