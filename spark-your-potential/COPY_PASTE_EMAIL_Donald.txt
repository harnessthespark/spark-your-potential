SUBJECT: Your Career Insights Report - Ready for Session 2

---

Hi Donald,

Hope you're well! Following our first session, I've processed your responses through the AI tool and the insights are really compelling.

I'm sending you your Career Insights Report ahead of Session 2 so you have time to read, reflect, and come prepared with your thoughts.

What's in the report:

• Your core pattern identified (it's powerful—I think you'll recognise yourself immediately)
• Analysis of your unique thread, superpowers, and unlock process
• How all of this connects to your current crossroads (UBS → VML → what's next)
• The core tension between what drains vs charges you
• Key questions for us to explore together in Session 2

Please take time to:

1. Read through the report - I'd suggest giving yourself 20-30 minutes in a quiet space
2. Note what resonates - What feels true? What surprises you?
3. Start thinking about the two opportunities (B2B agency and Smart Energy) in light of these patterns
4. Complete the homework prompts at the end if you can - but don't worry if you don't get to everything; we'll work through it together

Homework prompts (from the report):

1. Evaluate the two opportunities using your new understanding of your patterns
2. Reflect on 3 moments in your career when you restored belief (not just delivered strategy)
3. Rate VML for authenticity (/10) and describe what a 10/10 authentic role would look like
4. Consider: What if neither opportunity is the right answer? What would you explore with complete freedom?

A note on the framework:

I'll send you a separate Decision-Making Framework document tomorrow that gives you a structured scorecard to evaluate opportunities. You can use it to rate the B2B agency and Smart Energy roles against your patterns and needs. We'll review your scores together in Session 2.

Looking forward to Session 2!

We'll dig into these insights together, start building clarity on which direction feels right (emotionally and rationally), and move you closer to that "clean, well-charged, sustainable electric ignition" you're seeking.

Let me know if you have any questions before we meet.

Best,
Lisa
