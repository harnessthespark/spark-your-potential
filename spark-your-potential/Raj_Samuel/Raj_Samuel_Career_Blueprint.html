                    <p>Being able to take digital strategy and articulate that it's a vehicle to carry messaging. He reframes context in cultural familiarity.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; color: #7f8c8d;">Five career outcomes that reveal your unique pattern of impact:</p>

                <div class="outcome">
                    <div class="outcome-title">Outcome #1: AMV/BBDO & Brands Transformation</div>
                    <p>AMV was systematically locked out of digital pitches. Brought in as freelance planning director for BT Digital pitch - we won. Then became Board Account Planner, Co-Innovation Director. Spent five years repositioning how the entire agency operated - from 90% TV to 60% integrated/digital. BT evolved from telco to tech brand (2M+ engaged). Aviva went from "insurance company" to "life enabler" (2M visits across 87 countries). Proved: when you understand culture deeply, technology stops being a separate problem.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="outcome">
                    <div class="outcome-title">Outcome #2: Cadbury Gorilla Digital</div>
                    <p>Fallon brought me in for digital strategy. The drumming gorilla ad was insane - no chocolate, no bite. Client was terrified. Ran workshops to create belief, showed how content lives in the world now. Built digital destination, found remixers to make it look organic. The workshop gave them permission to be brave. Campaign became one of the most famous of the 2000s. Creative was brilliant - but it was the digital strategy and workshop that gave them courage to greenlight it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="outcome">
                    <div class="outcome-title">Outcome #3: Arley's Brand Creation</div>
                    <p>First time client-side. Brand Director for plant-based startup. Transformed generic "plant-based startup" into "heritage comfort brand" - secured 3 major retailer listings in 12 months, £1.2M pre-launch revenue. Cultural research revealed the "comfort paradox": 73% of flexitarian consumers wanted familiarity over innovation. Everyone chased "the future" when the opportunity was "the familiar, but better." Brand still going strong with their own factory, selling across Europe.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="outcome">
                    <div class="outcome-title">Outcome #4: Malice Arts - Immersive Events</div>
                    <p>2014-2019. Created immersive horror experiences - Malice in Wonderland, 1984 vs 1984, Inferno/Paradiso. Twisted pop culture: Tron crash-landing in a club, Narnia glitching inside the Matrix. Ten events, 5,000+ guests, 85% return rates, brand sponsorships, press coverage. Proved: when you create worlds people want to enter - not just events they attend - they come back. Audiences want to be transported, not just entertained.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="outcome">
                    <div class="outcome-title">Outcome #5: Lemons.life → Quilter Partnership</div>
                    <p>Co-founded with Alex after her husband's death exposed broken financial planning for women. Created brand strategy - went with "Lemons" instead of narrow "wills" name. "Life will always throw Lemons." Spotted early that the real story wasn't about death - it was about women's financial vulnerability across career breaks, caring, divorce, widowhood. Quilter now investing. Women selling to women. Turning finance upside down for women.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;">"I spot the cultural-emotional truth hiding beneath the business problem - the thing people sense but can't articulate yet. Then I make that truth tangible. Sometimes through strategic reframing, sometimes through research that reveals invisible patterns, sometimes through creating proof that builds belief."</p>
                    <p><strong>The thread is:</strong> Ahead of the curve, he makes the invisible visible - spotting where culture has already moved before brands catch up.</p>

                        <li>Cadbury: "We're becoming a content company" → No, this ad is an invitation for more</li>
                        <li>Arley's: "Plant-based = the future" → No, flexitarians want the familiar, done better</li>

                <h3 style="color: #a855f7; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">Your Recognition</h3>
                <div class="insight-box">
                    <p><strong>The ability I've been underestimating:</strong> My ability to bridge external and internal culture - spotting where culture's already moved outside, then transforming how organisations operate inside to match it. I've been underselling cultural transformation as strategy delivery.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The pattern I now see:</strong> I spot the cultural-emotional truth hiding beneath the business problem, then make it tangible so people can act on it. The unlock is always about giving permission - to be brave, to reframe, to see bigger opportunities. The result feels obvious in hindsight, but only because I made the invisible visible first.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The transformation I enable:</strong> I help people and organisations see the cultural truth they couldn't articulate, then give them permission to act on it with confidence. It's not just delivering insights - it's creating belief and making the scary thing feel doable.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The permission I'm giving myself:</strong> I don't just do strategy - I create transformation. I'm a cultural translator who spots where culture's already gone and makes the path visible so brands can get there.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 15px;">Cultural transformation through experience design</p>
                    <p>Being recognised for cultural transformation means being valued for shaping brand and strategic direction through the lens of culture and entertainment — not as a layer added at the end, but as a core driver of how people connect, behave, and care.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I do my best work when I'm involved early enough to influence direction, rather than being brought in once decisions are already locked. My contribution is usually about grounding strategy in what actually resonates with people in the real world — drawing on culture, entertainment, play, and human instinct to make ideas feel relevant, confident, and alive.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The transformation I want to be known for:</strong> Helping brands stop treating people like "audiences" and start treating them like humans again. Moving organisations from messaging and media plans to experiences that actually land — where culture isn't decoration, it's the engine.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Target titles:</strong> Strategy Director, Brand Director / Brand Strategy Director, Experience Director, Experience Design Director</p>

                            <li>Being in culture, not commenting on it from a distance</li>
                            <li>High trust / high autonomy: being given the reins to shape direction</li>

                        <li>Places where culture and entertainment are taken seriously as part of the strategy, not something added at the end</li>
                        <li>Environments where I'm trusted with real responsibility and given room to shape direction, not just execute</li>
                        <li>Organisations comfortable with ambiguity and figuring things out as they go</li>
                        <li>Teams with taste and curiosity, where play is encouraged and ideas actually get built</li>
                        <li>Situations where strategy naturally turns into something real — an experience, a moment, a space people can step into</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>AMV</strong> was the highest point — the right agency at the right time. Co-Innovation Director role is where I really came alive — helping change how the agency operated, not just what it produced.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Arley's</strong> — given the reins to define the brand, make decisions, figure things out. That freedom to create direction from scratch really suits me.</p>

                        <li>Roles where culture is treated as an add-on and experience only shows up at the end</li>

                        <strong>The Pattern:</strong> I do my best work when I'm able to spot the cultural or emotional truth beneath the brief and help turn that into something people can actually experience. I thrive where there's permission to be brave, to reframe the problem, and to make work that feels human rather than polished.

                <div class="insight-box">
                    <p style="font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 15px;">A great Monday for Raj:</p>
                    <p>Starts with a real brief and a real space. At my best when I'm thinking about how something will actually be experienced, not just how it will be described. That might mean walking a retail environment, standing in a venue, or sketching out how someone moves through a space — where they enter, what they see first, what they hear, how it builds, and what moment they leave with.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Day-to-day:</strong> Translating business or brand problems into experiences. Instead of asking "what's the message?", asking "what do we want people to feel, and how do we design that feeling?" That's where music, sound design, lighting, pacing, and participation come in — borrowing from theatre, live entertainment, and culture to create moments that feel intentional and memorable.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The work:</strong> Helping teams move away from flat communication and towards something more immersive. Turning a product launch into a piece of theatre. Turning a retail environment into a world you step into. Turning an idea into something people can physically experience, not just be told about.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Collaborating with:</strong> Creatives, designers, producers, and technologists — shaping the concept, stress-testing whether it actually creates magic, and pushing it beyond the obvious. Hands-on: shaping the narrative, mapping the journey, refining the moments.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>By end of day:</strong> Something tangible exists — a clear experience idea, a spatial journey, a sensory concept, a prototype, or a moment you can imagine stepping into.</p>

                    <div style="background: #fef3c7; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 20px; border-left: 4px solid #f59e0b;">
                        <strong>The problems I like solving:</strong> How to make brands feel alive, how to turn strategy into something people can feel in their bodies, and how to create experiences that stay with people long after they've left the room.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.8;">I'm a Creative Strategy Director who works through culture and entertainment, because that's how people actually feel things.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">I've lived across countries and languages, worked agency-side, brand-side and founder-side, and spent years experimenting in underground, music-led immersive worlds where you quickly learn if something works. People either feel it, or they leave.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The pattern's always the same. People want to do things, not be told things. My job is spotting the human truth under what a brand is trying to say or do, and turning it into experiences people choose to step into and carry with them.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 style="color: #7c3aed; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">5-Minute Pitch</h3>
                <div class="insight-box">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm a Creative Strategy Director who works through culture and entertainment, because that's how people actually feel things. It's also how brands stay alive without constantly shouting for attention.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I've lived across countries and languages, worked agency-side, brand-side, and founder-side, and spent years experimenting in underground, music-led immersive worlds. Those spaces are a great reality check. You don't get polite feedback. You don't get the benefit of the doubt. You know very quickly if something works. People either feel it or they leave.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Across all those environments, I started noticing the same pattern. Organisations often think their problem is execution. The campaign. The platform. The format. But more often than not, the real issue is cultural. There's a mismatch between what the organisation is trying to say and where people already are emotionally or behaviourally.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A lot of my work is about spotting that mismatch early. The human truth sitting underneath the brief, usually felt but not yet named. Once that becomes clear, the work gets simpler. Not easier. Simpler. It stops being about convincing and starts being about permission.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">People don't want to be told what to think or feel. They want to do things. They want to step into something, test it, play with it, and decide for themselves. When brands understand that, the work shifts. It moves from persuasion to participation. From messaging to experience.</p>
                    <p>I'm most interested in work where culture, entertainment, and experience aren't treated as add-ons, but as the main way organisations connect with people. Creating things that don't just get noticed, but get remembered, returned to, and carried forward.</p>

                    <ul style="margin-left: 15px; line-height: 2;">
                        <li><strong>"We need a campaign."</strong> → What people actually need is something they can step into, not be spoken at.</li>
                        <li><strong>"We need to explain this better."</strong> → If it needs that much explaining, something's off in what people are actually encountering.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Can we make it clearer?"</strong> → Clarity helps, but how it feels usually matters more.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Is this too risky?"</strong> → Risky compared to what people already ignore every day?</li>
                        <li><strong>"We need more messaging."</strong> → People don't lack messages. They lack moments that mean something.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Will people get it?"</strong> → They don't need to get it. They need to feel it.</li>
                        <li><strong>"What's the content strategy?"</strong> → This isn't content. It's an invitation.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Can we control how people respond?"</strong> → No — but we can design how it feels to step into it.</li>
                        <li><strong>"We need proof before we commit."</strong> → Sometimes you don't get proof until people actually experience it.</li>
                        <li><strong>"This feels a bit unconventional."</strong> → So does culture, most of the time.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3 style="color: #7c3aed; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">What I Actually Want</h3>
                <div class="proposition-box">
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I want to work somewhere that genuinely believes culture and experience are not outputs, but levers.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A role where I'm trusted to shape direction early, not decorate decisions late.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I want to build things people feel, not just explain things people understand.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I want proximity to real creative work, real makers, real audiences, and enough influence to turn instinct into action.</p>
                    <p>And I want to be somewhere that values curiosity, play, and experimentation as strengths, not risks.</p>

                    <p style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 15px;">"What's the brave thing I've been avoiding saying?"</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>I don't want to just advise transformation anymore. I want to create it.</strong></p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">I'm not interested in roles that optimise messaging when the real problem is how people feel, behave, and participate.</p>
                    <p>And I'm done pretending that culture, entertainment, and play are optional extras — they're the main event.</p>

                        <li>What environments will actually let me do this work at the scale it deserves, and which ones should I stop trying to bend?</li>
                        <li>Is 'Strategic Mischief' a positioning I should fully commit to, and if so, how do I deploy it without it being misunderstood or softened?</li>
                        <li>Where am I still holding back out of fear of being seen as 'too much' — and what would it look like to step fully into the identity I'm already operating from?</li>
                        <li>If we looked at the next year as a narrative arc rather than a job move, what should I be optimising for?</li>
