SPARK YOUR POTENTIAL - 24/10/2025
==================================================

THE EVIDENCE COLLECTION
-------------------------
Outcome #1:
I helped 3 major agencies create more effective Effies papers, draing a clear line between their comms activities and the business and marketing effects. I built them a stronger, tighter and more compelling story that increased their chances of wining an award.

Outcome #2:
For UBS, we noticed that their brand campaign wasn't being followed through the journey and they needed both a competlling front end and rigorous back end infrastructure. I enabled a digital brand journey, content magents and campaign strcuture which not ony increased familiairity (the brand team's goal) but leads (the goal of wealth management, the lead business unit), building a new client relationship in the process and driving leads

Outcome #3:
Challenge: Reposition UBS.com for a new generation
of HNWIs and corporates who viewed the brand as
legacy.


Insight: In wealth management, the digital experience is
the brand — credibility depends on premium, seamless
journeys.


Role: Created new ubs.com purpose, audience
strategy, measurement, and connected journeys.


Impact: Transformed UBS.com into the brand’s flagship,
incrasing leads and client revenue.

UBS was still seen as a traditional analogue brand and UBS.com wasn't doing the job of creating a seam;less digital experiene for a new generation of HNWIs. I and the team embedded ourselved with the client to deliver amd educate UBS on a transformation stratey. We created a .com purpose, audience frameworks, customer journeys, measurrement framwerowk and governamce tools in collaboaration with brand team and BUs. The results was a the foundations for comprehensive re-engineering of UBS.com for a new generation
Wrap-up: We turned UBS.com into a digital crown jewel
— a seamless luxury experience that proved
technology can deliver trust, consistency, and growth.

Outcome #4:
UBS neeeded to elevate itself above commodities logisitcs We found an insight: Its real value came from solving complex businessproblems — something employees lived daily but the world rarely saw.

Gettng under the skin of the company, with the team, we redefined UPS as “United Problem Solvers” and builta world-first UPS × TED platform for employees to share solutions on the world stage.

Impact: Boosted revenue growth, brand perception, and
employee pride for 400,000 staff worldwide.


Wrap-up: We proved UPS wasn’t just about parcels — it
was about people solving problems through human
ingenuity, and its meaningful impact on businesses and
people.

Global repositioning | +12% revenue | increased
consideration | increased employee pride

Outcome #5:
Working closely with the AMD team, we set out to turn them from a challenger brand in an Intel-dominated market.

Getting under the skin of the company, we saw AMD’s real differentiator was its capability to advance the world.

Impact: Elevated AMD from a specs-driven
competitor to a visionary leader recognised by
analysts, investors, and customers. Cof


Wrap-up: We shifted AMD from promoting specs to
shaping progress — establishing it as a visionary
leader that advances both industry and society.

Platform: AMD Together We Advance

THE INSTINCT AUDIT
------------------
When You Knew Before You Knew:
That our client wasn't looking for a killer ad campaign, they were looking for a marketing solution that would help them internally and externally

The Questions Only You Ask:
1. Why has no one done this before?
2. What help does soeone really need (but is afraid to ask)?
3. Why aren't we asking more people for input (clients and consumers)?

What You Notice First:
I notice the gap between what people say and what they actually do. Most people listen to the words in a brief or in a meeting — I listen for the tension underneath: what’s really motivating a behaviour, what’s being avoided, or what’s not being said. That gap is usually where the real opportunity lies.

I notice energy shifts — when people lean in, pull back, flold their arms or light up. It’s often subtle, but it tells me everything about what’s resonating and what’s true. Whether it’s a team dynamic or a client’s body language, that instinct helps me cut through noise and find what matters.

I notice the pattern that no one’s named yet — the hidden logic behind why something works or doesn’t. Whether it’s a brand that’s lost its edge or a creative idea that isn’t landing, I instinctively spot the gap between intent and impact.

THE EFFORTLESS ABILITY
----------------------
What Feels Easy:
Strategic Clarity (my superpower)

Making sense of complexity.
I can walk into a dense business problem — layers of data, competing opinions, shifting briefs — and instinctively find the through-line. Synthesizing the noise into a clear, motivating story feels so natural I sometimes forget it’s a skill.

Connecting Creativity to Commercial Impact

Linking creative ideas to commercial outcomes. For me, creativity and effectiveness have never been opposites — they’re part of the same equation. Translating a brand idea into measurable business impact just feels intuitive, like breathing.

Reading the room and reframing the narrative.
I can sense when a team, client, or idea has lost its centre — and naturally find the language or angle that brings everyone back into alignment. It doesn’t feel like effort; it’s just how my brain works.

Helping others think more clearly and feel reassured.
I find it easy to unlock other people’s thinking — to simplify, sharpen, and reframe until they see the path forward themselves. It’s called described as “mentoring” or “facilitation” inin corporate speak, but to me it’s just conversation.

"Of Course" Moments:
The Simplifier of Complexity

“Of course — it’s not about selling the product, it’s about proving the our promise.” I can take a dense ecosystem (tech, finance, logistics, transformation) and distil it into a story people feel and believe. I cut through technical clutter and bring it back to the simple, human truth that makes the business make sense.

“Of course — brand and performance aren’t separate things. They’re two sides of the same growth system.”
Clients come to me thinking in silos — brand here, demand there. I help them see how brand strategy fuels pipeline, how creative drives ROMI, and how the two reinforce each other in measurable ways. I can make the invisible connection obvious.

“Of course — that’s why it isn’t working.”
I have an instinct for spotting contradictions others miss — when the brand promise, people's expectations, customer experience, and communications aren’t aligned. I can reframe the problem not as “How do we say it better?” but “How do we make it truer for everyone?”

I bring empathy and language that cuts through jargon. I make clients and others realise that the real competitive advantage isn’t technology or spend — it’s humanity. I give brands and organisations permission to sound like people again.

“Of course — creativity only matters if it moves the numbers.”
I bridge art and analytics naturally. When others hide behind buzzwords or metrics, I reframe effectiveness as the creative act itself — proving that emotion and evidence can (and must) coexist.

THE TRANSFORMATION MIRROR
--------------------------
Client Before:
UBS was a world-class financial institution that looked and sounded like every other bank in its category — rational, conservative, and self-referential.

Their communications snd experiences were siloed, product-led, not purpose-led. They talked about “solutions,” “advice,” and “markets,” but rarely about people. Internally, marketing was often viewed as a cost centre rather than a growth engine.

They behaved like a cautious siloed incumbent — measured, careful, and constrained by compliance and hierarchy. The creative work reflected that: technically correct, emotionally invisible.

Client After:
UBS began to think and act like a team, and as a modern, human brand — one with a unifying philosophy and a clear organising idea: “Banking is our craft.” (our brand platform for them)

They started telling stories about people, not products — craftsmanship over commoditisation. That shift reoriented team involved in everything from comms to client experience to UBS.com. Marketing evolved from explaining what they do to demonstrating who they are.

Culturally, teams became braver. They leaned into creative partnerships, worked more closely wwth each other, built a digital-first ecosystem, and started measuring effectiveness not just by efficiency, but by brand and behavioural outcomes.
They went from a bank that communicated like a bank to a brand that acted like a craftsperson — confident, creative, and customer-obsessed.

WHAT FINDS YOU
---------------
Problem Magnet:
People come to me when things feel stuck.
When the story doesn’t add up, when teams are circling without progress, when team members feel lost, or when the business knows what it does — but can’t articulate why it matters.

They may call it a strategy problem, a brand problem, or a go-to-market challenge, but what they’re really bringing me is a clarity problem.

I attract problems where complexity, ego, and emotion have tangled together — where logic alone won’t fix it, and creative energy needs direction.

The Problems They Bring (Even When I Don’t Advertise It)

Brand paralysis: “We can’t explain who we are anymore — every deck says something different.”

Team misalignment: “The marketing team says brand, sales says pipeline, the C-suite says ROI — and we can’t find the common language.”

Creative conflict: “We’ve got all the ingredients for great work, but the team’s lost belief in the idea.”

Purpose drift: “We’ve got numbers and targets, but no narrative anyone’s proud of.”

Leadership friction: People quietly ask for your read on dynamics — “Why isn’t this team clicking?”, “Why does everything feel heavier than it should?”

The Hidden Human Layer

Even when I'm brought in for strategy, I end up diagnosing people' beliefs— helping people reconnect to meaning, possibility, and each other.

I give indiiduals and teams permission to drop the armour, say what they actually think, and rebuild clarity and confidence from there.

I turn something personal into something workable.

How Others See You:
People see me as the person who brings clarity when things are murky. I'm the one they call when the story has lost its shape, the strategy feels abstract, or a team needs to rediscover what actually matters.

They describe me as thoughtful, calm, sharp, and unfailingly grounded — the strategist who can turn complexity into something simple, human, and motivating. Clients talk about ,my ability to “make everything click.” Colleagues often say I'm the adult in the room — sometimes because I'm cautious, but also because I bring perspective and pattern recognition when others are still reacting.

People trust mebecause I don’t posture or spin; I listen, distil, and then drop the one line that reframes the entire problem.

I'm not the loudest voice in the room — and sometimes, in rooms full of senior stakeholders, that makes it harder to find my moment to speak. But when I do, people stop talking. My contribution carries weight precisely because it’s measured. I don't perform or shout loudly, I clarify

People often say, “I wish you’d spoken sooner — that’s exactly what we needed to hear.” That’s also part of my power: you speak when it matters.

RECOGNITION SUMMARY
------------------
Underestimated Ability:
My underestimated ability is how powerfully I can shift belief — not just thinking. I don’t just clarify ; I change how people feel about the work, each other, and what’s possible

Pattern Recognised:
Transformation through clarity — taking something complex, fragmented, or forgotten and giving it focus, humanity, and momentum. I turn big, abstract ambitions into stories people can believe in and act on.

Transformation I Enable:
I help people move from confusion to conviction. They leave my conversations clearer, more confident, and reconnected to an overall purpose — able to see not just what to do next, but why it matters.

Permission I'm Giving Myself:
I’m giving myself permission to own the scale of my impact — to stop downplaying the fact that I don't have the confidence to make my voice heard. I’m willing to claim that I can transform how organisations and people think, feel, and perform.
