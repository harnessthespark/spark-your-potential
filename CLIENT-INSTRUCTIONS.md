**Welcome to your ability recognition exercise!**

This tool helps you discover the extraordinary abilities you think are ordinary.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Access the tool here:** https://stingray-app-7kg9p.ondigitalocean.app/

**Time needed:** 30-45 minutes (but you can pause and come back anytime)

**What you'll need:**
- Recent examples of client work/outcomes
- A quiet space to reflect
- Honest self-reflection (no one else will see your answers unless you share them)

## 📝 How It Works

### **5 Discovery Sections:**

1. **📊 The Evidence Collection**
   List your last 5 client outcomes. What changed for them? What did you notice that they couldn't see?

2. **🎯 The Instinct Radar**
   Explore your intuitive abilities. When do you "just know" something? What questions do you naturally ask?

3. **✨ The Effortless Ability**
   Identify what feels "too easy" to be valuable (but actually isn't). What do others struggle with that feels natural to you?

4. **🔄 The Transformation Mirror**
   Map the journey your clients take. What does "before" look like? What does "after" look like? What creates that shift?

5. **🧲 What Finds You**
   Notice what problems and people naturally attract you. What keeps showing up? How do others describe what you do?

### **✨ AI-Powered Insights (Optional)**

After completing sections, you can click:
- **"Help Me See Patterns with AI"** - Reveals the thread connecting all your outcomes
- **"Reveal My Unlock Pattern with AI"** - Shows your unique transformation signature

These AI features are powered by Claude and will analyse your responses to highlight patterns you might miss.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### **Be Specific**
Don't write: "I helped them do better"
Do write: "They went from spending 10 hours/week on admin to having a system that runs itself"

### **Include What You Noticed**
What did you see that they didn't? What question did you ask? What pattern did you spot?

### **Trust Your "Easy"**
If something feels obvious to you, that's probably your superpower. Write it down even if it seems too simple.

### **Use Client Language**
What did they actually say? "You helped me see..." or "I never realised I could..."

### **Don't Overthink It**
Your first instinct is usually right. If you're stuck, move to the next section and come back.
