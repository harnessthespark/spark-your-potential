SUBJECT: Your Career Insights Report + Decision-Making Framework - Session 2 Prep

---

Hi Donald,

Hope you're well and had a good rest of the week.

Following our first session, I've processed your responses through the AI tool and the insights are really exciting.

I'm sending you TWO documents ahead of Session 2 so you have time to read, reflect, and come prepared with your thoughts.

**DOCUMENT 1: Career Insights Report**

This is your strategic analysis connecting your patterns to your current crossroads.

What's in it:
• Your core pattern identified: "You don't fix strategies. You restore belief systems."
• Analysis of your unique thread, superpowers, and unlock process
• How all of this connects to your current situation (UBS → VML → what's next)
• The core tension between what drains vs charges you
• Key questions for us to explore together in Session 2

**DOCUMENT 2: Decision-Making Framework**

I'm including a separate Decision-Making Framework document that gives you a structured scorecard to evaluate the two opportunities (or any future opportunities).

What's in it:
• The Four Core Tests (Belief Transformation, Authenticity, Sustainability, Growth & Impact)
• A detailed scorecard to rate opportunities out of 10 on 18 criteria
• Your deal-breakers (red flags to avoid, green flags to pursue)
• Interview questions to ask to gather information
• Reflection prompts to interpret your scores

**How to use these together:**

1. **First, read the Career Insights Report** (20-30 minutes in a quiet space)
   - Note what resonates - What feels true? What surprises you?
   - Start thinking about the B2B agency and Smart Energy roles in light of these patterns

2. **Then, use the Decision-Making Framework** to score both opportunities
   - Score each opportunity against the 18 criteria
   - Be honest - this is for you, not them
   - Pay special attention to any scores below 4 on "High Weight" criteria - these are potential deal-breakers
   - Trust your gut as well as the numbers - if something scores high but doesn't feel right, that's important data

3. **Complete the homework prompts** from the Career Insights Report:
   - Reflect on 3 moments in your career when you restored belief (not just delivered strategy)
   - Rate VML for authenticity (/10) and describe what a 10/10 authentic role would look like
   - Consider: What if neither opportunity is the right answer? What would you explore with complete freedom?

**No pressure to complete everything** - we can work through parts of it together if needed. But the more you can reflect before Session 2, the deeper we can go together.

• Move you closer to that "clean, well-charged, sustainable electric ignition" you're seeking

Looking forward to it,
Lisa
